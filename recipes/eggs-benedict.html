    <h1>Eggs Benedict</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Decadence is what makes eggs Benedict a star of the brunch table. To get there, order and timing are key. First, you'll want to
    <br>make your hollandaise. While intimidating in theory, the process is a lot like making mayonnaise. If the emulsion is stable, it won't
    <br>break, even when held at room temperature. Next, poach your eggs, and toast the English muffins while you crisp up the Canadian bacon.
    <br>From there, it's as simple as stacking your ingredients and sprinkling them with herbs, salt and pepper. Once you've mastered this basic
    <br>version, you can explore its variations: Add sliced avocado, or even swap in some smoked salmon (eggs Hemingway) or wilted greens for the
    <br>Canadian bacon (eggs Florentine).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne or hot paprika, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the hollandaise: Melt butter in a small pot over medium heat until it's foamy but not yet beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place egg yolks and 2 teaspoons water in a blender. Start blending, and, working very slowly, add the hot, melted butter until it's all
        <br>incorporated. (If it starts to get too thick to blend, add ½ teaspoon of water.) Add lemon juice and cayenne, though feel free to adjust
        <br>the amounts to taste, and season with salt and pepper. Transfer the hollandaise to a small bowl, and place plastic wrap directly on the
        <br>surface so it doesn't form a skin. Set aside. (It will keep at room temperature while you work.)</li>
        <li>Poach the eggs: Fill a medium pot with 3 inches of water. Add vinegar, season with salt and bring to a simmer. (Look for just a few
        <br>bubbles; it should never boil.) Using the handle of a spoon or spatula, stir the water with a clockwise motion. Gently crack an egg into
        <br>the center of the pot, letting the water swirl around it and allowing the white to envelop the yolk. Repeat with remaining eggs — you 
        <br>could probably do up to four at a time. Check the eggs after 4 minutes: Use a slotted spoon to lift an egg out of the water, and feel the 
        <br>white for firmness. If it's not quite done, slide it back in for another minute or so. Let cook until the whites are just set, but the 
        <br>yolks are still completely runny, 4 to 5 minutes. Once eggs are perfectly poached, remove from the water, and let drain on a plate lined 
        <br>with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Set eggs aside.</li>
        <li>Using a toaster, toaster oven or regular oven, toast the English muffins until crisp and golden brown. Don't be afraid to toast them 
        <br>thoroughly: They'll be covered in hollandaise and poached eggs, and will need to be sturdy.</li>
        <li>Cook Canadian bacon or ham (or bacon) in a medium skillet over medium–high heat until golden brown and just crisp at the edges, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Benedict: Place eight halves of English muffin on a plate and butter them generously. Top each with a slice of Canadian bacon, 
        <br>ham or bacon, then a poached egg. Spoon hollandaise sauce over and sprinkle with chives, dill, flaky sea salt and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
